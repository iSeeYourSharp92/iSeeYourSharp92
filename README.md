What's up

I currently work in IT support in the education sector and am learning Javascript to create a web based game using phaser.js (through codecademy) in my spare time.
Sometimes work can be draining (other weeks not so much) and I'm finding it hard to stay on track and commit to the process - I think I really need to colloborate with
someone with experience and patience who's interested in (or works in) game development and is looking for a little side project. I have a bit of previous experience in 
Python but in reality I am a complete noob when it comes to coding - I do really enjoy it though and that isn't a forced thing. 

My end goal is to learn C# and ++, hopefully one day working on some terrifying horror game(s) that will basically give people PTSD (I don't really want that for people -
but I'll settle for a nightmare or two ;)). 

If anyone would be willing to collaborate with and guide me, I believe that would give me a greater sense of responsibility to that person(s) and project - 
which I would take more seriously than just motivating myself.

DM me if you're interested and I can go through what coding experience I have with you and some ideas for a game :)
